The goal of this document is to explain how the library works on a high-level.

## Datasets and Models

You can use doubtlab to check your own datasets for bad labels. Many of the
methods that we provide are based on the interaction between a dataset and a
model trained on that dataset. For example;


```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1_000)
model.fit(X, y)
```

This examples shows a logistic regression model trained on the `load_iris` dataset.
The `model` is able to make predictions on the dataset and it's also able to
output a confidence score via `model.predict_proba(X)`.

You could wonder. What might it mean if the confidence values are low? What might
it mean if our model cannot make an accurate prediction on a datapoint that it's trained on?
In both of these cases, it could be that nothing is wrong. But you could argue that
these datapoints may be worth double-checking.

## Pipeline of Doubt Reasons

The doubtlab library allows you to define "reasons" to doubt the validity of a datapoint.
The code below shows you how to build an ensemble of the two aforementioned reasons.

```python
from doubtlab.ensemble import DoubtEnsemble
from doubtlab.reason import ProbaReason, WrongPredictionReason

# Define the reasons with a name.
reasons = {
    "proba": ProbaReason(model=model, max_proba=0.55),
    "wrong_pred": WrongPredictionReason(model=model),
}

# Put all the reasons into an ensemble
doubt = DoubtEnsemble(**reasons)
```

This ensemble represents a pipeline of reasons to doubt the validity of a label.

!!! Note "Internal Details"

    A `DoubtEnsemble`, technically, is just an ensemble of callables. You could
    also choose to use lambda functions to define a reason for doubt. The example
    below shows an example of a lambda function that's equivalent to what `WrongPredictionReason`
    would do.

    ```python
    DoubtEnsemble(
        wrong_pred=lambda X, y: (model.predict(X) != y).astype(float16)
    )
    ```

    When it's time to infer doubt, the `DoubtEnsemble` will call each callable reason in order,
    passing `X`, `y` and listening for an array that contains "doubt-scores". These scores are just
    numbers, but they follow a few rules.

    - When there is no doubt, the score should be zero
    - The maximum doubt that a reason can emit is one
    - The higher the doubt-score, the more likely doubt should be. For now the library emits 0/1 scores, but this may change in the future.

## Retreiving Examples to Check

There are multiple ways of retreiving the examples to check
from the doubt pipeline.

### Get Indices

You could simply use the `DoubtEnsemble.get_indices` method to get the indices of
the original data that are in doubt.

```python
# Get the ordered indices of examples worth checking again
indices = doubt.get_indices(X, y)
```

In this case, you'd get an array with 7 elements.

```
array([ 77, 106, 126, 133,  83, 119,  70])
```

You can inspect the associated rows/labels of the examples via:

```python
X[indices], y[indices]
```

### Get Predicates

While the indices are useful they don't tell you much about how the
ordering took place. If you'd like to see more details, you can also
retreive a dataframe with predicates that explain which rows triggered
which reasons.

```python
# Get the predicates, or reasoning, behind the order
predicates = doubt.get_predicates(X, y)
```

The `predicates` dataframe contains a column for each reason. The index
refers to the row number in the original dataset. Let's check the top 10 rows.

```python
predicates.head(10)
```

|     |   predicate_proba |   predicate_wrong_pred |
|----:|------------------:|-----------------------:|
|  77 |                 1 |                      1 |
| 106 |                 1 |                      1 |
| 126 |                 1 |                      0 |
| 133 |                 1 |                      0 |
|  83 |                 0 |                      1 |
| 119 |                 1 |                      0 |
|  70 |                 0 |                      1 |
| 105 |                 0 |                      0 |
| 107 |                 0 |                      0 |
| 104 |                 0 |                      0 |

There's a few things to observe here.

- The ensemble assumes that overlap between reasons matter is a reason to give a row priority, moving it up in the dataframe.
- The `.get_indices` method tells you *what* deserves checking and only returns candidates worth checking. The `.get_predicates` method tries to explain *why* these rows deserve to be checked and therefore returns a dataframe with a row for each row in `X`.
- The index of the predicates dataframe refers to rows in our original `X`, `y` arrays.

## Why do this exercise?

It's bad enough to have bad labels in your training data, but if you have bad labels in your validation then
it's *really* game over for your machine learning models. There's [ample evidence](https://labelerrors.com/)
that many pre-trained academic models have suffered from this problem. So there's a legitimate concern that
it may be a problem for your dataset as well.

The hope is that this library makes it just a bit easier for folks do to check their datasets for bad labels.
It's an exercise worth doing and the author of this library would love to hear anekdotes.

## Does this scale?

You might be dealing with a large dataset, in which case you may want to
be concious of compute time. Suppose you have a setup that looks something like:

```python
from doubtlab.ensemble import DoubtEnsemble
from doubtlab.reason import ProbaReason, ShortConfidenceReason, LongConfidenceReason

# Suppose this dataset is very big and that this computation is heavy.
X, y = load_big_dataset()
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1_000)
model.fit(X, y)

# This step might be expensive because internally we will be calling
# `model.predict_proba(X)` a lot!
ensemble = DoubtEnsemble(
    proba=ProbaReason(model)
    short=ShortConfidenceReason(model),
    long=LongConfidenceReason(model)
)
```

Then you might wonder if we're able to speed things up by precomputing our
`.predict_proba()`-values. You could use `lambda`s, but you can also use
common utility methods that have been added to the reason classes. Most of
our reasons implement a `from_pred` or `from_proba` method that you can use.
See the [API](https://koaning.github.io/doubtlab/api/reasons/) for more details.

That way, we can rewrite the code for a speedup.

```python
import pandas as pd
from doubtlab.ensemble import DoubtEnsemble
from doubtlab.reason import ProbaReason, ShortConfidenceReason, LongConfidenceReason

# Suppose this dataset is very big and that this computation is heavy.
X, y = load_big_dataset()
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1_000)
model.fit(X, y)

# Let's precalculate the proba values.
probas = model.predict_proba(X)

# We can re-use the probas below. Note that some reasons require extra information.
# Also beware that `y` and `probas` are globals now! 
predicate_dict = dict(
    proba=ProbaReason.from_proba(probas)
    short=ShortConfidenceReason.from_proba(probas, y, classes=len(set(y)), threshold=0.2),
    long=LongConfidenceReason.from_proba(probas, y, classes=len(set(y)), threshold=0.4)
)

# This dataframe now contains the predicates
pd.DataFrame(predicate_dict)
```


## Next Steps

You may get some more inspiration by checking some of the examples of this library.

Once you're ready to give the library a spin we encourage you to explore the suite
of reasons that this library supports.

### General Reasons

- `RandomReason`: assign doubt randomly, just for sure
- `OutlierReason`: assign doubt when the model declares a row an outlier

### Classification Reasons

- `ProbaReason`: assign doubt when a models' confidence-values are low for any label
- `WrongPredictionReason`: assign doubt when a model cannot predict the listed label
- `ShortConfidenceReason`: assign doubt when the correct label gains too little confidence
- `LongConfidenceReason`: assign doubt when a wrong label gains too much confidence
- `MarginConfidenceReason`: assign doubt when there's a small difference between the top two class confidences
- `DisagreeReason`: assign doubt when two models disagree on a prediction
- `CleanlabReason`: assign doubt according to [cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab)

### Regression Reasons

- `AbsoluteDifferenceReason`: assign doubt when the absolute difference is too high
- `RelativeDifferenceReason`: assign doubt when the relative difference is too high
- `StandardizedErrorReason`: assign doubt when the absolute standardized residual is too high
